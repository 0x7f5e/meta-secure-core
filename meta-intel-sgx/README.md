### Overview
This layer provides the support of Intel Software Guard Extensions
(Intel SGX), which is an Intel technology for application developers
seeking to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification.

The Linux SGX software stack is comprised of the Intel SGX driver, the
Intel SGX SDK, and the Intel SGX Platform Software.

### Intel SGX Driver
The recipe sgx-driver provides a out-of-tree driver for the Linux Intel
SGX software stack, which will be used until the driver upstreaming process
is complete.

### Intel SGX SDK and PSW
The recipes are still in development.

### Hardware Support
Please check [this site](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware) for the
latest information.
